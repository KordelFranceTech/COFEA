# CoFEA for Swarm Intelligence
(Policy) Co-Training for Factored Evolutionary Algorithms

This repository is a work in progress. It builds off of the work conducted by Dr. John Sheppard, Dr. Shane Strasser, and
Dr. Stephyn Butcher in Factored Evolutionary Algorithms (FEA) [1]. See the references below for the particular works that
this repository credits in regards to FEA:

In addition to the work of Sheppard, et al., this repository also builds off of the work of Ma, et al. (2020) in their original paper 
of Self-paced Multi-view Co-training (SPaMCo) [8]. It has been adapted to learn a policy for a Markov decision process 
through reinforcement learning. The foundation of this work was taken from the repository constructed by Ma, et al. below:
